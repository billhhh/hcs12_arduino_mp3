//Sending "YES" to Hyperterminal (Tera Terminal) via Serial Com0 (SCI0) on Dragon12+ board
//Serial COM0 (SCI0) is the RS232 next to the LCD.
//Serial COM0 (SCI0) is used by the Serial Monitor to communicate (downLOAD and RUN) with the Trainer board 
//Modfied from Example 10-9C in HCS12 book by Mazidi & Causey
//This program must be downloaded into Dragon12 via COM0 using HCS12 Serial Monitor
//Use the usual steps in CodeWarrior. a) Make (F7) b) Set SW7 =00 (LOAD) position, c)use Debug (F5) to download.  
//After it is downloaded, d)close the Debugger Windows of CodeWarrior from step C, and e) set SW7=10 (RUN) position
//(f) bring up HyperTerminal (or Tera Term in Windows Vista and Windows 7), 
//and g) press RESET on the Dragon12 board and it will run this program. 
//(h) to download another program, close the HyperTerminal and set SW7=00 for LOAD.   

//Serial Monitor uses COM0 to download (LOAD,SW7=00) and works at 48 MHz
//The RUN mode (SW7=10) of Dragon12+ works at 8 MHz.
//We use COM0 to download using Serial Monitor 
//and then switch to RUN to send data to HyperTerminal using the same COM0
