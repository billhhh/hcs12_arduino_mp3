//Sending "YES" to Hyperterminal via Serial Com1 (SCI1) on Dragon12+ board
//Serial COM1 (SCI1) is the RS232 next to the power connection, and COM0(SCI0)is next LCD. 
//You need two x86 PCs for this program 
//PC#1 for CodeWarrior/Serial Monitor uses COM0 to communicate(download/run) with Dragon12 board, 
//PC#2 for HyperTerminal to display data via COM1  
//Modfied from Example 10-9C in HCS12 book by Mazidi & Causey
//This program must be downloaded into Dragon12 via COM0 (SCI0) using HCS12 Serial Monitor
//Use the usual steps in CodeWarior. a) Make (F7) b) Set SW7 =00 (LOAD) position, 
//(c)use Debug (F5) to download.  
//After it is downloaded, d) connect the 2nd x86 PC serial port to COM1 of Dragon12+ board
//bring up e)HyperTerminal (or Tera Term in Windows Vista and Windows 7) on the 2nd x86 PC, 
//and f)press F5 in Debug step C to start running this program via Serial Monitor.     

//Serial Monitor uses COM0 to download (LOAD,SW7=00) and works at 48 MHz
//We use COM0(SCI0) to download and run using Serial Monitor on the main x86 PC 
//and use COM1(SCI1)to connect to the 2nd x86 PC to display data on HyperTerminal at the same time. 
//The program sends "YES" to HyperTerminal of the 2nd x86 PC via COM1(SCI1)
